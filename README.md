# Machine Learning - Classification

Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including sentiment analysis, ad targeting, spam detection, risk assessment, medical diagnosis and image classification. The core goal of classification is to identify to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition and is considered an instance of supervised learning.

The topics covered include:
- Linear classiÔ¨Åers/logistic regression
- Decision trees
- Boosted trees and random forests 
- Stochastic gradient descent

and some important concepts such as:
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Decision boundaries
- Ensemble methods
- Online learning
